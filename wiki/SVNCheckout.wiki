SVN Checkout Instructions


= Details =

svn checkout http://zombiesrus5.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ 

User name if needed: zombiesrus5-read-only (TortoiseSVN did not require it).

Contains all the current rebellion port for Sins of the Fallen including Fall of Kobol.

Using an SVN client means much smaller downloads as you'll only be getting changes to files.

TortoiseSVN

 # Please download and install TortoiseSVN
 # Next, navigate to your Mods-Rebellion v1.xXX folder (located in ...Documents\My Games\Ironclad Games\Sins of a Solar Empire Rebellion)
 # Right-click the folder and select "SVN Checkout" (NOTE: You will need to repeat this Y times in order to add in all the folders of the mod) 
 # Set URL of repository: svn://urlhere.com/folder/subfolder and the checkout directory name Sins of a Solar Empire Rebellion\Mods-Rebellion v1.0XX\MOD NAME
 # Click Ok and let it download. (If the folder is very large:) It is known that at times the download will abort while downloading. If this occurs, run SVN Checkout again, and do not delete the folder you already have, overwrite it instead.
 # You should now have a full directory with a green checkmark
 # To update: Just right-click the folders and select "SVN Update".
